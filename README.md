# GoodReads-Analysis

## Introduction

I realized while applying for jobs I had very little on my GitHub. I decided to put together a sampler of various DS skills, including some preprocessing of data, plot creation, machine learning, analysis, etc. But what dataset to use? Well, why not my GoodReads data? I already have it freely available! 

## How can I use my own data?

See the very top of the notebook for instructions, you just need a GoodReads account with some data in it, and ideally a willingness to use the goodreads enhancement tool (see next point).

## Libraries and such?

They're all mentioned inside the notebook, I use many, but I wanted to give particular thanks to [Enhance-Goodreads-Export](https://github.com/PaulKlinger/Enhance-GoodReads-Export) which unlocked genres and more accurate dates read.

## Examples of plots this creates
